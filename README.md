# üö® Problem & Solution

## Problems
**1. IPFS Data Accessibility Issues:**
 - When uploading data to IPFS, if there are no active seeds, the data cannot be found.
 - This issue arises because data is distributed across the network, and if specific seeds are not active, access to the data may be impossible.

**2. Need to Build Separate CDN:**
 - Many services need to build their own CDN to ensure the speed and accessibility of data on IPFS.
 - This results in additional costs and management burdens, partially losing the decentralized benefits of IPFS.

## Solutions
**1. Using Celestia DA for Data Assurance:**
 - NFT.info records data on the blockchain using Celestia DA (Data Availability).
 - This ensures the availability of data, solving the accessibility issues of distributed file systems like IPFS.
 - Even without active seeds, data can be found, enhancing the reliability of data access.

**2. No Need to Build Separate CDN:**
 - NFT.info is designed to always be online without the need to build a separate CDN service.
 - It utilizes third-party services while ensuring that data is always accessible anytime, anywhere.

This reduces costs and management burdens while maintaining the benefits of decentralization.
By addressing these issues, NFT.info can effectively provide stable and efficient data access, overcoming the traditional challenges of IPFS.

# üìå KEY Point

Services that use IPFS build their own separate CDN to guarantee speed or data. Or record the image offchain
**nftinfo.online (NFT.info)** is not only recorded on the blockchain using Celestia DA, but is also designed so that there is no need to build a separate CDN service.
